# Fake Store API - Cart Endpoints Testing by Kawsar Newaz Chowdhury

This repository contains API tests for the **Fake Store API**, specifically focusing on the **Cart Endpoints**. The tests are implemented using **Postman** and **Newman** to automate the testing of the API endpoints such as creating carts, fetching carts, updating carts, and validating the API responses.

## Features:
- **Get All Products**: Fetch all products from the store.
- **Get All Carts**: Fetch the list of all carts.
- **Get a Single Cart**: Fetch a specific cart by ID.
- **Add a New Cart**: Create a new cart with product details.
- **Update a Cart**: Modify an existing cart.
- **Delete a Cart**: Remove a specific cart from the store.

## Project Structure:
The project contains the following files:
1. **Postman Collection**: The collection of API requests and tests.
   - `Fake Store API - Cart Endpoints.postman_collection.json`
2. **Postman Environment**: Defines environment variables for the API requests.
   - `FSP.postman_environment.json`
3. **Newman HTML Report**: Generated after executing the tests using Newman.
   - Example: `RestfulAPI-2025-04-24-17-28-36-928-0.html` (Test result file).

## Prerequisites:
To run the tests, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- **Postman**: To manually test and debug API requests.
- **Newman**: Command-line tool to run Postman collections.
- **Node.js**: Required to install **Newman** via **npm**.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager to install dependencies.

### Install Node.js and Newman:
1. Download and install **Node.js** from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install **Newman** globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g newman
   ```

## Setup and Usage:
### Importing the Collection and Environment in Postman:
1. **Download the files**:
   - **Postman Collection**: [Fake Store API - Cart Endpoints.postman_collection.json](file-link)
   - **Postman Environment**: [FSP.postman_environment.json](file-link)
   
2. **Import into Postman**:
   - Open **Postman** and go to **File > Import**.
   - Import both the collection and the environment files.

3. **Set up the environment**:
   - In Postman, select the environment **FSP**.
   - Ensure that the `Base_url` and other environment variables are correctly set for your API (if necessary).

### Running the Collection in Postman:
1. **Select the Environment**: Choose the imported **FSP** environment from the dropdown in the top-right corner.
2. **Run the Collection**: Click **Run** on the collection to execute the API tests.

### Running the Collection with Newman:
Newman allows you to automate the running of Postman collections via the command line.

1. **Run the collection using Newman**:
   After installing **Newman**, run the following command in your terminal (make sure to replace paths with your local file paths):
   ```bash
   newman run "Fake Store API - Cart Endpoints.postman_collection.json" -e "FSP.postman_environment.json" -r htmlextra
   ```

2. **Generate the HTML Report**:
   The `-r htmlextra` option will generate a detailed **HTML report** after running the collection.

## API Endpoints Tested:
The collection includes the following API endpoints for testing:

### 1. Fetch All Products (GET)
- **Endpoint**: `/products`
- **Description**: Retrieve all products from the store.
- **Tests**:
  - Status code should be 200.
  - Response should be in JSON format.
  - Response body should contain properties like `id`, `title`, `price`, etc.

### 2. Get All Carts (GET)
- **Endpoint**: `/carts`
- **Description**: Retrieve all carts.
- **Tests**:
  - Status code should be 200.
  - Response time should be less than 200ms.
  - Each cart should contain `id`, `userId`, `date`, and `products`.

### 3. Get a Single Cart (GET)
- **Endpoint**: `/carts/{cart_id}`
- **Description**: Fetch a specific cart by ID.
- **Tests**:
  - Status code should be 200.
  - Response should include the cartâ€™s properties like `id`, `userId`, `date`, `products`.

### 4. Add a New Cart (POST)
- **Endpoint**: `/carts`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 5,
    "date": "2020-02-03",
    "products": [
      { "productId": 5, "quantity": 1 },
      { "productId": 1, "quantity": 5 }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Tests**:
  - Status code should be 200.
  - The response should include `id`, `userId`, `products`.

### 5. Update a Cart (PUT)
- **Endpoint**: `/carts/{cart_id}`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 3,
    "date": "2019-12-10",
    "products": [
      { "productId": 1, "quantity": 3 }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Tests**:
  - Status code should be 200.
  - The response should contain updated cart details.

### 6. Delete a Cart (DELETE)
- **Endpoint**: `/carts/{cart_id}`
- **Tests**:
  - Status code should be 200.
  - The response should contain cart details with `id` and `userId`.

## Test Assertions and Reports:
- **Response Status Code**: Verify that the correct status code is returned (e.g., 200 for success).
- **Response Time**: Ensure that the response time is within acceptable limits (e.g., under 200ms).
- **Response Schema**: Validate that the response adheres to the expected schema.
- **Required Fields**: Check that the response contains the necessary fields like `id`, `title`, `products`, etc.

### Example of Assertion Failures:
- **Response Time**:
  ```plaintext
  Expected response time to be below 200ms, but received 1207ms.
  ```
- **Missing Property**:
  ```plaintext
  Expected the response to contain property 'id', but it was missing.
  ```

## Example of Test Results in HTML Report:
The HTML report generated by Newman will include:
- **Test Summary**: The overall results of the test run.
- **Requests**: A list of all API requests made during the test.
- **Assertions**: Information about each assertion and whether it passed or failed.
- **Response Times**: Data on the response times for each request.

## Example of a Failed Test in the HTML Report:
If the test fails due to response time exceeding the limit, you might see:
```
Failed Test: Response time is less than 200ms
Error Message: expected 1207 to be below 200
```
